# Rename a device in Intune

You can use the **Rename device** action to rename a device that is enrolled in Intune. When you use this action, the device's name is changed in Intune and on the device.

You can rename the following types of devices:

- Android Enterprise:
  - Corporate-owned work profiles
  - Dedicated devices
  - Fully managed
- iOS/iPadOS supervised devices with iOS 9.3 and later
- macOS 10 - Corporate-owned devices
- Windows - Corporate-owned devices
- Corporate-owned co-managed devices that are Azure AD joined

If a device isn't listed here, it's not supported.

This feature doesn't support renaming hybrid Azure AD Windows devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Renaming of Android Enterprise devices will only change the name in Intune and not on the device itself. The Device name in Intune is a friendly name that users are free to change.

## Rename a device

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Choose **Devices** > **All devices** > choose a device > **...** > **Rename device**.
3. In the **Rename device** pane, type the new name in the text box. You can use letters, numbers, and hyphens. The name must contain at least one letter or hyphen. Android Enterprise dedicated, fully managed, and corporate-owned work profile devices are an exception, and donâ€™t require a letter or hyphen.
4. If you want to restart the device after renaming it, choose **Yes** next to **Restart after rename**.
5. Choose **Rename**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an enrollment profile (iOS) that uses a Device Name Template, the device will be renamed but will revert to using the template upon the next sync with Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> It may take 10 minutes or more for a renamed Android Enterprise device to update in the Devices blade.

## Windows device rename rules

When renaming a Windows device, the new name must follow these rules:

- Less than or equal to 63 bytes, not including trailing NULL
- Not null or an empty string
- Allowed ASCII: Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens
- Allowed Unicode: characters >= 0x80, must be valid UTF8, must be IDN-mappable (that is, RtlIdnToNameprepUnicode succeeds; see RFC 3492)
- Names must not contain only numbers
- No spaces in the name
- Disallowed characters: { | } ~ [ \ ] ^ ' : ; < = > ? & @ ! " # $ % ` ( ) + / , . _ *)

> [!NOTE]
> This is only supported for Azure AD Joined only devices. Trying to rename a hybrid object will break the connection to ADDS.


## Bulk rename devices

You can choose to rename devices in bulk, based on the device platform. The bulk rename option uses the same rules as renaming a single device. However, you must also include one of the following variables as part of the device name:

- **{{serialnumber}}** - Add the device's serial number to the name.
- **{{rand:x}}** - Add a random string of numbers, where x equals the number of digits to add.

To use the bulk rename action:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Choose **Devices** > **All devices** > **Bulk Device Actions**.
3. On the Basics page, for *OS* select the platform of the devices you want to rename, and then for *Device action* select **Rename**.
4. Complete the configuration wizard.

## Next steps

To see the status of the **Rename** device action, check the **Overview** page for the device.
